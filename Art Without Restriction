      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Caroline, a passionate artist based in [Your Location]. My work explores colour, texture, and emotion through various mediums including oil, acrylic, and watercolour. Each piece tells a story, and I hope it connects with you.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>With over 10 years of experience, my art has been featured in local exhibitions and private collections. I draw inspiration from nature, people, and abstract forms. Creating art is not just my profession—it's my way of sharing perspective.</p>
